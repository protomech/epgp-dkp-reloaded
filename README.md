=================

Fork of http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/epgp-dkp-reloaded/repositories/mainline/

The primary goal here is to develop an alternative to storing EP and GP information in officer notes. Instead, the EP and GP information can be stored in a database from AceDB, and synchronized using www.epgpweb.com. This will better support guild alliances as well as guilds that already use officer notes for other purposes.
